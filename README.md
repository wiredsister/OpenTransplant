## Democratized Organ Procurement Transplant Network For The People

### Project Status: 

In Development! Not ready to be used in any pilot or production scenario.

### Project Ethos

We believe every country and community, regardless of wealth or ability, should be able to operate an organ transplant network for its citizens. We believe this organ transplant network should be safe, auditable, free of fraud, waste, and abuse; we believe this system should benefit life and reduce death. 

### Key Features & Road Map:
- organ decay is reduced
- patient outcomes are optimized for
- endangered populations are protected
- the system can measure end to end actions and the implications of policy changes quickly and easily
- the system should be near real-time with zero downtime
- the system should not require paper or human intervention
- the system will be modern and incorporate medical research (HLA crossmatching, organ sizing innovations, modern logistics & tracking)

### Sources & Thanks

This entire application was designed and built using publically available information from OPTN, UNOs, and HRSA found via Google as well as numerous medical papers from scholarly journals. See PAPERS.md (TODO: must add citations & PAPER.md file for medical lit.) for details.

### Architecture
- Web API Layer: Elixir Phoenix Web API Stack
- FrontEnd: Node.js, SCSS styling
- Backend Matching & Scheduling: OCaml services

### Short Term Tech Road Map

1. Webapp for OPOs
2. Webapp for Patient
3. EHR FHIR API integration for EPIC & Cerner
4. Gherkin & Cucumber Scenario tests for each organ & user health

## Build & Run

### OCaml Environment

#### Windows Machine

1. Follow these instructions to get WSL for Debian: 
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10
2. apt-get install ocaml
3. Proceed to Build step

#### Linux

1. apt-get install ocaml
2. Proceed to Build step

#### OSX

1. brew install ocaml
2. Proceed to Build step

### Visual Studio Code Setup

Packages Used:

- OCaml and Reason IDE (@ext:freebroccolo.reasonml)
- Remote - WSL  (@ext:ms-vscode-remote.remote-wsl)
- FiraCode (install _is not_ through VSCode store, but rather follow instructions here: https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode >> and change font-family setting in **VSCode > Editor** to `"Fira-Code"`)
- Docker - (https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/wsl/) to install 

### Build

Go to root directory where `dune-project` is and run:

```
sh build.sh
sh start.sh
```

### Clone Image

```
docker login
docker pull wiredsis/opentransplant:latest
```
